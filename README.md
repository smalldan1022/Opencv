## Introduction

Opencv cookbook is for the usage of providing the opencv methods used frequently in my work. Due to the efficiency and the integration, this cookbook is created



## Method list

Opencv method lists for miscellaneous image process problems.

- [x] Data leakage -> divide the dataset by patients
- [x] Different dataset distribution -> use five fold method
- [x] Save all the train values -> don't miss any train/valid values or the initial training hyperparameters
- [x] Plot the result for you to check -> check whether the model got the right features or not
